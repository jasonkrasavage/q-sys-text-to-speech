:: This line writes/overwrites any existing file without locking it
::      This introduced errors where on a file changed notification, TYPE wasn't finished, and QSD would see a partial script and
::      throw an error. It would recover on the subsequent file changed notifications when the file was completely written.
:: TYPE "C:\plugins-layout-test\%1\%1.qplug" > "%userprofile%\Documents\QSC\Q-Sys Designer\Plugins\%1\%1.qplug"

:: As a solution, this line was added to write/overwrite files and lock them so that QSD couldn't access them until it was finished.
::      QSD was then throwing an access error while the file was being written, so I added code in C# to catch access denied errors,
::      in favour of waiting for the next changed notification that allowed the file to be read (i.e. file copying finished)
